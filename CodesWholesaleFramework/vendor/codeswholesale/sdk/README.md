        $product->getImageUrl(ImageType::SMALL) // product image url
    }

    $account->getCurrentBalance(); // current balance value
    $account->getCurrentCredit(); // current credit value
    ```
    
6.  **Create single code order**

    ```php
    $code = \CodesWholesale\Resource\Order::createOrder($product);
    /**
     * Code as a TEXT
     */
    if($code->isText()) {
        /**
         * If code is sent as TEXT the use case is very simple,
         * just retrieve code value from response message and present it to your customer
         */
        echo $code->getCode(). " <br />";
    }
    /**
     * Code as a IMAGE
     */
    if($code->isImage()) {
        /**
         * If code is sent as IMAGE, we provide for you an image writer.
         * Image writer will decode base64 data and save it to given directory.
         *
         * Afterwards you can present the code to your customer from $fullPath,
         * which is a direct path to your image.
         *
         * In single order image code is returned in the response message.
         * In a batch order $code->getCode() will do additional server request for each image.
         */
        $fullPath = \CodesWholesale\Util\CodeImageWriter::write($code, "/the/path/to/somewhere/");
        echo $fullPath;
    }
    
    if($code->isPreOrder()) {
        // nothing much to do with PreOrdered code - we are working on Post Back functionality,
        // CW will send you a post back information
        // once the code is added to your order, post back will be send directly to your website.
        // For now you can send an notification email
        echo "Pre-order";
    }
    
    ```
    
7.  **Create order for multiple codes**

    ```php
    $codes = \CodesWholesale\Resource\Order::createBatchOrder($product, array('quantity' => 10));
    ```
    
8.  **Receive pre-ordered codes from CW's post back request**

    To receive pre-ordered codes from CW at first point you must configure your post back URL that will be responsible for handling CW's requests. In order to do that, follow this steps:
    
    - Sign in to [CodesWholesale](https://app.codeswholesale.com/)
    - Click you email address in top navigation
    - Go to Web API tab
    - Configure and test your post back url
    
    If the URL is successfully configured, you should be able to handle CW's requests as follow:

    ```php
    // method will parse request and extract parameters
    // get order id, and id of ordered product from request params
    $productOrdered = $client->receiveProductOrdered();
    // ask for bought codes
    $allCodesFromProduct = \CodesWholesale\Resource\Order::getCodes($productOrdered);

    /**
     * Go through bought codes and do your logic
     */
    foreach ($allCodesFromProduct as $code) {}
    ```
    
    If you send test request from Web API tab and your script is configured to work with sandbox it will download ten fake images.
